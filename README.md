CHIP (Chip Handles kIm Packages)
================================

Chip is a simple package manager with great flexibility that handles the
packages needed to run OpenKIM tests and models.  Chip implements lightweight
version switching so that multiple versions of a package can be used in
different tests and models.  Different versions of a package can even be used
in separate processes at the same time.  Chip also supports dependency
resolution, consistency checking, and self updating.
