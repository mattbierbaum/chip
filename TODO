On the list of things to implement:

* reconsider pip -t (--target) so that pypi dependencies are installed correctly
    - what is the appropriate flag for setup.py?
    - perhaps move setup.py moves to be pip installs from file://directory
      (I checked that this works for just giving the directory name)
    - SCRIPTS ARE NOT INSTALLED THIS WAY!
    - regular setuptools installs dependencies and actually works, probably
      going to get rid of pip from all of these things, leave it around
      for downloading files lol
    - DONE, pip removed except for downloads...

* install from source
* detect architecture / arch specific packages
* packages-list and download all, concatenate
* allow multiple packages to provide the same requirement perhaps through
  a 'provides' mechanism.  BUT! that messes with how we currently resolve
  dependencies...

* sqlite database for faster resolution (important!)
